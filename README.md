## Overview

Check Point MCP Chat abstracts the complexity of multi-system security operations by providing an intelligent conversational layer over Check Point's Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. Instead of manually SSH-ing into gateways, parsing logs, or navigating multiple management interfaces, administrators can query their entire infrastructure using natural language.

### Key Capabilities

- **Intelligent Query Orchestration**: Two-stage LLM architecture (Intent Analyzer + Technical Planner) that understands admin intent and automatically routes queries across 11 specialized Check Point MCP servers
- **Fleet-Wide Operations**: Aggregate data from all managed gateways, analyze policies across the entire infrastructure, and identify anomalies at scale
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Automatically handles API pagination, rate limiting, parameter discovery, and data aggregation with anti-hallucination safeguards
- **Policy & Rule Intelligence**: Universal output formatting matching Check Point GUI structure (8-column NAT tables, 7-column Access rules, HTTPS inspection with Site Categories)
- **Malware Analysis**: Native file upload with asynchronous Check Point Threat Emulation cloud sandbox integration, hash verification, and detailed XML report retrieval
- **Military-Grade Security**: AES-256-CBC encryption for all credentials, master password protection, no plaintext secrets on disk

### AI Architecture: Dual-Model Intelligence

The application employs a sophisticated two-model AI architecture designed for security operations:

#### 1. **Planner Model** (Intent Analysis & Orchestration)
- **Role**: Analyzes natural language queries to extract structured intent, identifies required Check Point infrastructure components, and generates technical execution plans
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Understands security context (firewall rules, threat prevention, HTTPS inspection, VPN tunnels)
  - Extracts parameters (gateway names, time ranges, IOCs, layer names) using intelligent regex patterns
  - Maps user intent to specific MCP server tools with prioritization scoring
  - Handles multi-layer resource discovery (HTTPS inspection layers, policy packages, gateway objects)
- **Recommended Models**: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`, `meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b`

#### 2. **Security Model** (Analysis & Response Generation)
- **Role**: Analyzes collected infrastructure data and generates actionable security insights with Check Point-specific expertise
- **Capabilities**:
  - Identifies security misconfigurations, policy conflicts, and threat indicators
  - Formats responses in Check Point GUI table structure (NAT, Access, HTTPS rules)
  - Provides troubleshooting guidance for connection issues, SSL/TLS decryption, and threat prevention
  - Detects anomalies in logs, gateway performance metrics, and IPS signatures
- **Recommended Models**: `meta-llama/llama-3.2-1b-instruct`, `saki007ster/cybersecurityriskanalyst`

Both models work together: the Planner decides **what** to fetch and **how** to fetch it, while the Security Model interprets **why** it matters and **what** to do about it.

### LLM Provider Options

Check Point MCP Chat supports two LLM deployment strategies to match your security and operational requirements:

#### **Ollama (Local Deployment)**
Ollama is an open-source platform that runs large language models locally on your hardware, providing complete data sovereignty. All queries and Check Point infrastructure data remain within your network, making it ideal for high-security environments with strict compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2). Once models are downloaded, there are no recurring API costs, and the system works offline. Best suited for organizations with powerful local hardware (GPU recommended) and air-gapped environments.

**Recommended Models:** Planner: `llama3.1:70b`, Security: `llama3.1:8b`

#### **OpenRouter (Cloud Deployment)**
OpenRouter provides unified access to cutting-edge LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta, Google) through a single API. It enables instant setup without GPU infrastructure, automatic scaling for variable workloads, and access to the latest frontier models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4. With pay-as-you-go pricing, teams only pay for actual usage. Ideal for rapid deployment, proof-of-concept projects, and organizations prioritizing the latest AI capabilities over data locality.

**Recommended Models:** Planner: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`, Security: `meta-llama/llama-3.2-1b-instruct`

You can also use a **hybrid approach**, mixing providers per model role‚Äîfor example, using Ollama for security analysis (keeping sensitive data local) while leveraging OpenRouter's Claude for superior planning and reasoning.

## Real-World Use Cases

### 1. **Rapid Incident Response**
**Traditional Approach**: SSH into each gateway ‚Üí run diagnostic commands ‚Üí parse output ‚Üí check management server ‚Üí correlate logs ‚Üí identify root cause (30-60 minutes)

**With MCP Chat**: 
```
"Debug SSL decryption failures on cp-gw for the past 2 hours"
```
**Result**: AI automatically fetches HTTPS inspection policies, SSL connection traces, certificate status, gateway diagnostics, and relevant logs from all sources, presenting a unified analysis in 45 seconds.

### 2. **Policy Review & Compliance Auditing**
**Traditional Approach**: Export rulebase ‚Üí open in Excel ‚Üí manually review each rule ‚Üí check NAT policies separately ‚Üí cross-reference objects ‚Üí document findings (2-4 hours per gateway)

**With MCP Chat**:
```
"Review all firewall policies on gw-prod-01 and identify overly permissive rules"
```
**Result**: Displays complete NAT and Access rulebases in GUI-matching markdown tables with AI analysis highlighting "Any-Any-Accept" rules, unused objects, and security risks in under 60 seconds.

### 3. **Fleet-Wide Threat Hunting**
**Traditional Approach**: Log into each gateway ‚Üí query threat logs ‚Üí filter by IOC ‚Üí export ‚Üí consolidate in spreadsheet ‚Üí analyze patterns (1-2 hours)

**With MCP Chat**:
```
"Search all gateways for connections to IP 185.220.101.45 in the last 24 hours"
```
**Result**: Automatically queries all management logs across the fleet, aggregates findings with pagination handling, and presents threat correlation analysis with recommended actions.

### 4. **Performance Troubleshooting**
**Traditional Approach**: SSH into gateway ‚Üí run fw ctl pstat, fwaccel stats, cpstat ‚Üí interpret cryptic outputs ‚Üí check interface stats ‚Üí correlate metrics (20-30 minutes)

**With MCP Chat**:
```
"Analyze gateway performance metrics on all production gateways"
```
**Result**: Executes 26 diagnostic tools in parallel with intelligent rate limiting, presents CPU/memory/connection stats, SecureXL status, and identifies performance bottlenecks with visual comparisons.

### 5. **Malware Analysis Workflow**
**Traditional Approach**: Download suspicious file ‚Üí upload to Check Point portal ‚Üí wait for sandbox ‚Üí check report ‚Üí interpret XML ‚Üí document findings (15-20 minutes)

**With MCP Chat**:
```
Upload file via UI ‚Üí "Analyze this file for malware"
```
**Result**: Auto-computes hash, submits to Threat Emulation cloud, monitors async job, retrieves verdict and detailed XML report, presents formatted analysis with severity scoring.

## Advanced Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Gateway Script Executor (Optional)

The Gateway Script Executor provides a secure way to execute diagnostic commands directly on Check Point gateways using the Management API's `run-script` function. This advanced feature enables LLM-driven diagnostics while maintaining enterprise-grade safety through multi-layer validation.

#### Safety Architecture

**Multi-Layer Command Validation:**
1. **Whitelist Validation** - Only pre-approved commands from Check Point R81/R82 CLI Reference Guide
2. **Pattern Blocking** - Regex-based detection of dangerous operations (cpstop, kill, rm, etc.)
3. **Special Character Filtering** - Blocks command chaining, redirects, and code injection
4. **Non-Interactive Enforcement** - Only snapshot commands allowed (e.g., `top -n 1`, no interactive TUIs)
5. **Audit Logging** - Every command execution is logged with timestamps

**What's Allowed (120+ Safe Commands):**
- ‚úÖ System info: `show version`, `fw ver`, `uptime`
- ‚úÖ Network status: `ifconfig`, `show interfaces`, `netstat -rn`
- ‚úÖ Firewall status: `fw stat`, `fw ctl pstat`, `fwaccel stat`
- ‚úÖ Cluster HA: `cphaprob state`, `cphaprob -a if`
- ‚úÖ Performance: `top -n 1`, `ps aux`, `cpstat os -f all`
- ‚úÖ VPN status: `vpn tu tlist`, `cpstat vpn`
- ‚úÖ Logs (read-only): `fw log`, `cat $FWDIR/log/fw.elg`

**What's Blocked:**
- ‚ùå Service control: `cpstop`, `cpstart`, `api restart`
- ‚ùå Process control: `kill`, `pkill`, `killall`
- ‚ùå File operations: `rm`, `mv`, `chmod`, `dd`
- ‚ùå Configuration changes: `set`, `add`, `delete`, `commit`
- ‚ùå Interactive shells: `vpn shell`, `cpview`, `cpconfig`
- ‚ùå Command chaining: pipes `|`, redirects `>`, substitution `$()`

**Complete command list:** `docs/GATEWAY_SAFE_COMMANDS_LIST.txt`

#### Prerequisites

Your Management API administrator user requires these permissions:

1. **Management API Login** ‚úì (You already have this if using Management MCP)
2. **Gateways ‚Üí Scripts (Write)** ‚Üê Required for run-script

**Setup in SmartConsole:**
```
1. Navigate to: Manage & Settings ‚Üí Permissions & Administrators
2. Select your API admin user ‚Üí Edit
3. Select Permission Profile ‚Üí Edit Profile
4. Go to: Gateways ‚Üí Scripts
5. Enable: Write permission
6. Click OK and Publish changes
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: `run-script` executes commands at expert/root level on gateways. Check Point acknowledges this limitation - there are no granular command restrictions at the API level. That's why this application implements its own strict validation layer.

#### How to Enable

1. **Enable in Settings UI:**
   - Open Settings page (‚öôÔ∏è icon)
   - Scroll to "Gateway Script Executor (Advanced)"
   - Check "Enable Gateway Script Executor"
   - Review the Management API permissions instructions

2. **Verify Permissions:**
   - Ensure your API user has "Scripts (Write)" permission in SmartConsole
   - Test with a safe command: `"Show gateway version on cp-gw"`

3. **Usage:**
   ```
   User: "Check gateway version on prod-gw-01"
   AI: [Validates command] ‚Üí Executes "fw ver" ‚Üí Returns output
   
   User: "Show cluster status"
   AI: [Validates command] ‚Üí Executes "cphaprob state" ‚Üí Analyzes results
   ```

The LLM automatically suggests appropriate diagnostic commands based on your query. All commands are validated before execution - even if the LLM suggests an unsafe command, it will be blocked by the validation system.

**Audit & Compliance:**
- All executions logged with timestamps, gateway names, and commands
- Only commands from audited whitelist (approved by security architect)
- Zero-risk: Cannot modify configurations or disrupt services
- Full transparency: See exactly what commands run
