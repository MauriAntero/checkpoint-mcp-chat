### 6. Cluster High Availability (ClusterXL)

```bash
cphaprob state                    # Cluster state (Active/Standby)
cphaprob stat                     # List state of all HA members

### 7. VPN & IPsec

```bash
vpn tu tlist                      # List all active VPN tunnels (read-only)
cpstat vpn                        # VPN daemon statistics
cpstat -f all vpn                 # Detailed VPN statistics
cpstat ike -f all                 # IKE daemon statistics
fw tab -t vpn_enc_domain_valid -f -u  # View encryption domains
```

**Note:** `vpn shell` is EXCLUDED - it opens an interactive maintenance shell with state-altering commands. VPN debug commands like `vpn debug on` are safe (user-space only) but generate large log files and are excluded from auto-execution.

---

### 8. Logging & Monitoring

```bash
fw log                            # View firewall logs
fw log -f                         # Follow/tail log in real-time
fw log -t <start> <end>          # Filter by timestamp
fw log -s <source_IP>            # Filter by source IP
fw log -d <dest_IP>              # Filter by destination IP
fw log -c <action>               # Filter by action (drop/accept)
fw log -n                         # Don't resolve hostnames
fw lslogs                         # List available log files and sizes
```

**Log File Locations (Read-Only):**
```bash
cat /var/log/messages             # System messages (last 100 lines recommended)
tail -100 /var/log/messages
cat $FWDIR/log/fw.elg            # Firewall logs
cat $FWDIR/log/vpnd.elg          # VPN daemon logs
cat $FWDIR/log/ike.elg           # IKE logs
cat $FWDIR/log/cpd.elg           # CPD (SIC) logs
```

### 9. Performance & Resource Monitoring

```bash
top -n 1                          # Single snapshot (non-interactive)
ps aux                            # Process list
vmstat 1 1                        # Virtual memory statistics (single snapshot)
free -m                           # Memory usage
cpstat os -f all                  # Complete system view (interfaces, routes, version, memory, CPU, disk)
cpstat os -f cpu                  # CPU utilization statistics
cpstat os -f multi_cpu           # CPU load distribution across cores
cpstat os -f memory              # Memory usage information
cpstat os -f ifconfig            # Interface table
cpstat os -f routing             # Routing table
cpstat os -f sensors             # Hardware sensors (temp/fan/voltage)
cpstat fw                         # Firewall blade statistics
cpstat fw -f policy              # Verbose policy information
cpstat fw -f sync                # Synchronization statistics
cpstat ha                         # HA state and statistics
cpstat blades                     # Top rule hits and connection counts
```

**Note:** Interactive versions (`top`, `cpview`, `vmstat` without `-n 1`) are EXCLUDED - they open interactive TUIs that can send signals or execute commands.

---

### 10. Check Point Services & Processes

```bash
cpwd_admin list                   # List all Check Point processes
cpwd_admin monitor_list          # List actively monitored processes
api status                        # API service status
cplic print                       # License information
```

---

### 11. Management & SIC

```bash
cpca_client lscert               # List certificates
```

---

### 12. Diagnostic Utilities

```bash
cpinfo                            # Collect diagnostic data bundle (read-only snapshot)
cpstat                            # List all available application flags
```

**Note:** `cpview` (interactive TUI) is EXCLUDED - it opens a full-screen monitoring interface with navigation controls.

## ðŸš« Commands NOT in Whitelist (Unsafe - Modifying/Disruptive)

The following commands are **BLOCKED** as they can modify configuration or disrupt services:

### Service Control
- `cpstop` - Stops Check Point services
- `cpstart` - Starts Check Point services
- `cphastop` - Emergency cluster stop
- `api restart` - Restarts API service

### Firewall Control
- `fw unload` - Unloads firewall policy
- `fw load` - Loads firewall policy
- `fw kill` - Kills processes

### VPN Control
- `vpn shell` - Opens interactive maintenance shell with state-altering commands
- `vpn tu tlist del` - Deletes VPN tunnels
- `vpn tunnelutil` (option 0) - Deletes all IPsec/IKE SAs
- `vpn debug on` - Generates large log files (safe but excluded)

### Interactive Tools (Unsafe - Can Execute Commands)
- `top` (without -n 1) - Interactive TUI with signal sending capability
- `cpview` - Interactive full-screen monitoring TUI
- `vmstat` (without count limit) - Continuous interactive output
- `fw monitor` - High CPU impact and interactive output (excluded)

### Configuration Changes
- Any `set` command
- Any `add` command
- Any `delete` command
- `commit` operations
- `cpconfig` - Configuration wizard (interactive shell)

### File Operations
- `rm`, `rmdir`, `unlink` - File deletion
- `cp`, `mv`, `dd` - File operations
- `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp` - Permission changes
- `mkfs`, `fdisk`, `parted` - Disk operations

### Process Control
- `kill`, `pkill`, `killall` - Process termination

### Debug Commands (High Impact)
- `fw ctl debug` - Kernel debug (can cause high load)
- `fwaccel stats -r` - Reset acceleration statistics

### Cluster Operations
- `clusterXL_admin down` - Disable cluster node

## Environment Variables (Safe to Read)

```bash
echo $FWDIR                       # FW-1 installation directory
echo $CPDIR                       # Check Point directory
echo $FWDIR/conf                  # Configuration directory path
echo $FWDIR/log                   # Logs directory path
```

---

## Additional Safety Notes

1. **All CLISH `show` commands are safe** - They are read-only by design
2. **Expert mode required** - Most `fw`, `cp`, and diagnostic commands require expert mode
3. **No command chaining** - Whitelist does not allow pipes (|), redirects (>), or command substitution ($(), `)
4. **Special characters blocked** - No use of `;`, `&`, `&&`, `||` for command chaining
5. **Single-snapshot only** - Commands like `top` must use `-n 1` for non-interactive single snapshots
6. **No interactive shells/menus/TUIs** - Commands that open interactive interfaces (e.g., `vpn shell`, `cpconfig`, `top`, `cpview`, `fw monitor`) are EXCLUDED - they can expose control sequences or state-altering operations
7. **Debug commands excluded** - Even safe user-space debug commands (e.g., `vpn debug on`) are excluded from auto-execution due to log file generation impact
